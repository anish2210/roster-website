## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Check logs immediately**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs roster-api --err
   ```

2. **Rollback to previous version**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/roster-api
   git log --oneline
   git reset --hard [previous-commit]
   cd server
   npm ci --production
   pm2 reload roster-api
   ```

3. **Verify health**
   ```bash
   curl https://api.yourdomain.ca/health
   ```

4. **Restore database (if needed)**
   - MongoDB Atlas → Backups → Restore to previous point-in-time

5. **Notify stakeholders**
   - Email client
   - Update status page (if available)

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ✅ Health check returns 200 OK
- ✅ No errors in PM2 logs for 15 minutes
- ✅ Database queries executing normally
- ✅ SSL certificate valid
- ✅ API responses <500ms (p95)
